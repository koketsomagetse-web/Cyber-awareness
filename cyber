# Cybersecurity: A Short Guide for Students

Why this matters
Cybersecurity means protecting computers, phones, and the data on them from theft, damage, or misuse. As a student you store personal info, schoolwork, emails, and passwords — all of which are targets. Good habits keep you, your classmates, and your school safer.

Quick overview
- Cybersecurity protects confidentiality (keeping data private), integrity (keeping data accurate), and availability (making sure you can access data when needed).
- Threats include scams, viruses, data leaks, account takeovers, and privacy invasions.

Common threats explained simply
- Phishing: Fake emails or messages that trick you into giving passwords or clicking malicious links.
- Malware: Software (viruses, ransomware, spyware) that harms devices or steals data.
- Weak passwords: Easy or reused passwords let attackers into multiple accounts.
- Public Wi‑Fi risks: Open networks can expose what you send and receive.
- Social engineering: Manipulation (often by people pretending to be someone you trust) to get information.

Smart habits to protect yourself
1. Use strong, unique passwords
   - Aim for long passphrases (3–5 random words or a sentence). Avoid obvious choices.
   - Never reuse passwords across important accounts (email, bank, school portal).

2. Turn on multi-factor authentication (MFA)
   - MFA adds a second check (text code, authenticator app, or hardware key). It blocks most account takeovers.

3. Keep software updated
   - Install updates for your phone, laptop, browser, and apps — they fix security bugs.

4. Think before you click
   - Don’t open suspicious emails or links. Check the sender's address and hover links to preview URLs.
   - Be cautious with attachments — especially .exe, .zip, or file types you weren’t expecting.

5. Use secure Wi‑Fi and a VPN when needed
   - Avoid sensitive work on public Wi‑Fi. If you must, use a reputable VPN and verify the network name.

6. Backup important files
   - Keep copies of assignments and notes in cloud storage or an external drive. Backups protect you from data loss or ransomware.

7. Protect your devices physically
   - Lock screens with PINs/biometrics and never leave devices unattended.

8. Be careful with social media
   - Limit personal information, check privacy settings, and think twice before sharing location or sensitive details.

If something goes wrong
- Change the password on the affected account and any accounts using the same password.
- Enable MFA if not already on.
- Scan your device with a trusted antivirus tool and restore from a backup if necessary.
- Tell your teacher or school IT if school accounts or devices are affected.

Career and learning pathways (if interested)
- Topics: network security, ethical hacking, digital forensics, secure software development.
- Start small: free online courses, school clubs, capture‑the‑flag (CTF) challenges, and mentorships.

Quick checklist (before submitting an assignment or connecting to campus networks)
- [ ] Strong, unique password
- [ ] MFA enabled
